# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to build up skills on web scraping methods. The task for this project was based on automating a web browser to visit different websites and extract data. Additionally, HTML elements and attributes were used in order to identify content for web scraping. The main goal of the task was put together a web-scraping project about the Mission to Mars.

The final process for the web-scraping project required the creation of three technical analysis:

1. Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere images with titles.
2. Create and update a web application with Mars Hemisphere images and titles.
3. Add Bootstrap components to the app.

During the final process, we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to automate a web browser and conduct a web scrape. Bootstrap components were used to customize and polish the web app created to showcase the project. A MongoDB database and a web application with Flask were also created to store and display the data from the web scrape.
